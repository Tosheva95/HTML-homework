        <h1>H1 = Heading 1</h1>
            <p>This is a paragraph (< P >), IMHO, it makes sense to have vertical spacing between header elements and paragraphs.</p>
            <p>This is also a paragraph.</p>
        <p>Line 1: This is a paragraph with four lines but:<br/>Line 2: It has self-terminating<br/>Line 3: line breaks (< br/ >) at<br/>Line 4: the end of every line.</p>
