In this resource, we’re looking at the best React UI component libraries and frameworks available on the web. But first:

## What is React?
**React** is an open-source JavaScript library that helps you build a top interface for both the web as well as mobile apps. It combines conveniently with other **JavaScript frameworks and libraries**, and contains tiny, standalone bits of code called components. It’s these components that are going to be in the spotlight in this resource.

The nice thing about components is that they’re modular without much app-specific dependencies. This means that you get to reuse the components to build awesome apps and interfaces super fast. And thanks to **Bit**, you can share them with other React enthusiasts too.

Before you start your next project with React, take a few minutes to scan this list of best React UI component libraries that can help you create an awesome looking UI.
